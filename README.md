# SimulationEnv
My various environments for simulating scientific stuff 

SimulationEnv is simple projects made by me. I create those to test my skills in C++, and to use this in future things. Feel free to optimze this, but someone probably made it better x)

# NOTE:
Orginal concept of environments and stimulation is NOT MINE! I was inspired by: [this guy](https://youtube.com/@primerblobs?si=4EyS0PHIEr1escsT) and his awesome videos (go check him out). This various project is only for educational purpose.
